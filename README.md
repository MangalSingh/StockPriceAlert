## Why this extension?

When products go out of stock or prices change, customers often leave and never return. This extension helps you recover sales by allowing shoppers to subscribe to:

- **Back in Stock alerts** (email notifications when items are available)
- **Price drop alerts** (email notifications when product price decreases)

For merchants, it provides actionable insights: identify the most subscribed products, spot demand trends, and refill inventory based on real intent.
